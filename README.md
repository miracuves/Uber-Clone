Let us explain how the taxi on-demand app operates. The first step for any rider is to download the app from Android Play Store or IOS App Store. Once they install the app they need to sign up and create a profile. On the other hand, the driver needs to do the same. Driver Profile gets approved by the Admin to provide services.

Now, the rider selects the destination of travel as the pickup location is auto-detect. After this select the vehicle type and in case of pool ride select no. of seats needed.

As soon as the rider places a request the nearby drivers are notified of the same. They can accept the request and see the place to go for pickup.

Once the driver arrives at the pick-up location user is notified. The rider gets into the cab, provides the driver with OTP and the trip gets started.

Once they reach the destination, the driver completes the trip. An invoice is generated which can be paid by the user in cash or card. It will be effortless if the rider used a wallet or card when booking the trip. The payment gets done and they can give reviews to one another.

This is the simple flow and what else can be better than a smooth ride and no hassles.
